StudyOffline is an open source tool that allows you to download the flashcards you have created on StudySmarter and study them offline.

In addition, StudyOffline is a PWA (Progressive Web App) with which you can also learn your flashcards on any smartphone.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Setup your own StudyOffline instance

At the moment we do not have published StudyOffline to any container registry yet but you can easily build it by hand.

The requirement is that Docker is installed.

To do this, you just need to run

`docker build https://github.com/piuswalter/StudyOffline.git#main -t studyoffline --no-cache`

Now your container is built and can be started with

`docker run -p 3000:3000 --name studyoffline -d studyoffline`

You can access StudyOffline in your browser on `https://localhost:3000/`.
